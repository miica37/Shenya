**About the video "Project Files Preview" on Youtube (old)** 

A promotion video has been created for the first release of Shenya and released on Youtube, however in Version 2 there are quite some changes made, to prevent confusion, the youtube video is now hidden from public (`It is accessible only by link <https://www.youtube.com/embed/JqUTn7AywF0>`_).
