.. note::
   Hair Curves from Blender are then exported to Maya to do some modifications (reduce edge loops for polycount opimizations, uv adjustment after reducing edge loops and also some shape adjustment to fix some geometry intersections or refinement on the shape of the hair).

   New changes made to the Blender hairs will need to go through the process of optimization in Maya again.
